# voting_app

### Freecodecamp Backend project.

This project requires that users can create and vote on a poll.

- Unauthenticated users can vote on any poll, only once. 
- (Multiple voting is filtered by IP address or login info).
- Authenticated users can create/delete their own polls and also add custom option to any poll to vote on that.
