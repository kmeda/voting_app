# voting_app

Freecodecamp Backend project.


This project requires that users can create and vote on a poll.

Unauthenticated users can vote on any poll, only once. (Multiple voting is filtered by IP address).
Authenticated users can create/delete their own polls and also add custom option to any poll to vote on that.

Here's the link to the app.
